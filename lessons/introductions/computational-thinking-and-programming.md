# Computational thinking (CT)

- Computational thinking (CT) rather than "just computer programming skills"

- Looking at a problem in a way that a computer can help people to solve it

- Formulating problems in a way that enables us to use a computer to help solve them

- CT is something that people do recursively and abstractly

- people can't write a program without engaging in computational thinking

# CT concepts and approaches

## CT concepts

- Logic --> predicting and analysing
- Algorithms --> making steps and rules
- Decomposition --> breaking down into parts 
- Patterns --> spotting and using similarities
- Abstraction --> removing unnecessary detail
- Evaluation --> making judgement

## CT approaches

- Tinkering --> experimenting and playing
- Creating --> designing and making
- Debugging --> finding and fixing errors
- Persevering --> keeping going
- Collaborating --> working together
